Compared to the original stencil operation applied to the 2D array, this code has been modified to optimize the operation in the following ways:

Thread Organization and Block Dimensions:
The original code directly calculates the row and column indices using 'blockIdx' and 'threadIdx' without considering the grid and block dimensions.

The optimized code uses separate variables ('tx', 'ty', 'bx', 'by') to represent the thread indices in the block and global indices of the block's corner.
These variables are used to compute the global indices ('row' & 'col') of each thread. Therefore, the grid and block dimensions are now considered when computing the global indices, making sure that all elements of the array are covered by the threads.

Overall operation:
When viewing the original code, we noticed that the stencil operation does not calculate the weighted sum of the border elements. 
This is due to the use of the conditional if statements used to check if the thread is within the interior of the array. 
Since the border elements do not have all of their neighboring values, they are not included within the operation.

for the optimized code, we removed the conditional if statements, and replaced them with individual if statements that check for the upper, lower, left and right neighbors separately. 
This way the operation will only include the present values to the weighted sum for each element, including the border. 
This allows the operation to be applied uniformly across the array.

Memory Access:
Both versions access memory in a similar way.
The codes directly access based on their global indices.
