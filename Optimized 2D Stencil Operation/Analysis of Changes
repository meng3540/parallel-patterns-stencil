Original Code:

__global__ void stencilOperation(int* input, int* output, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (row < N && col < M) {
    int index = row * width + col;
    if (row > 0 && row < N - 1 && col > 0 && col < M - 1) {
      output[index] = input[index - width] + input[index] + input[index + width] +
        input[index - 1] + input[index + 1];
    }
    else {
      output[index] = input[index];
    }
  }
}

Optimized Code:

__global__ void stencilOperation(int* input, int* output, int width, int height) {
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;
    int bx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int by = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
    int row = by + ty;
    int col = bx + tx;

    if (row < height && col < width) {
        int sum = input[row * width + col];
        if (row > 0)           sum += input[(row - 1) * width + col];
        if (row < height - 1)  sum += input[(row + 1) * width + col];
        if (col > 0)           sum += input[row * width + col - 1];
        if (col < width - 1)   sum += input[row * width + col + 1];
        output[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

Thread Indexing:
  - In the original code, the row and column indices were found using 'blockIdx' and 'threadIdx', however the computation didn't include the border values.
  - In the optimized code, the thread indices are used to compute global indices for each thread. This ensures that all elements, including the border, are processed.

  Original Code:

  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  Optimized Code:

  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;
  int bx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
  int by = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
  int row = by + ty;
  int col = bx + tx;

  Difference:
  - The original code uses 'row' and 'col' are directly calculated using 'blockIdx' and 'threadIdx' to determine the global index of the thread
  - The optimized code uses 'tx' and 'ty' to represent the thread indices within the block, while 'bx' and 'by' represent the global indices of the block's corner. 
    'row' and 'col' are computed by adding the indices together


Stencil Operation:
  - In the original code, the stencil operation was performed only on interior elements, excluding border elements from the computation.
  - In the optimized code, the stencil operation is applied to all elements within the array bounds. 
    The conditional statements that exclude border elements from the stencil computation are removed, allowing the operation to be applied uniformly across the array.

  Original Code:

  if (row > 0 && row < N - 1 && col > 0 && col < M - 1) {
    // Perform stencil operation
  } else {
    // Copy input value
  }

  Optimized Code:

  if (row < height && col < width) {
    // Perform stencil operation
  }

  Difference:
  - In the original code, a conditional statement checks if the thread is within the interior of the array (excluding border elements) before performing the stencil operation.
  - In the optimized code, this conditional statement is removed, allowing the stencil operation to be performed on all elements within the array bounds, including border elements.


Grid and Block Dimensions:
  - The grid and block dimensions remain similar in both versions, with minor adjustments made in the optimized version to ensure coverage of all elements.

  Original Code:

  dim3 grid((N + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE, (M + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE);
  dim3 block(BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE);

  Optimized Code:

  dim3 grid((M + BLOCK_SIZE_X - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE_X, (N + BLOCK_SIZE_Y - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE_Y);
  dim3 block(BLOCK_SIZE_X, BLOCK_SIZE_Y);

  Difference:
  - In both codes, the grid and block dimensions are calculated to cover the entire input array.
  - In the optimized code, BLOCK_SIZE_X and BLOCK_SIZE_Y are used to define the block dimensions, allowing for more flexibility in adjusting the block size along each dimension.
