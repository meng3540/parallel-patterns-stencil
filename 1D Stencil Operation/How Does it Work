Output given by the input array: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Step-by-step calculation:

Memory Transfer: The input array is copied from the host (CPU) memory to the device (GPU) memory using cudaMemcpy.

Kernel Launch: The CUDA kernel stencilOperation is launched with a grid of blocks and threads. Each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. The number of blocks is calculated to ensure all elements of the input array are covered.

Stencil Operation: Each thread in the CUDA kernel calculates the stencil operation for a specific index of the output array. The stencil operation involves adding the neighboring elements (left, current, right) from the input array.

For the index 0, there is no left neighbor, so we ignore that term.
For the index N-1, there is no right neighbor, so we ignore that term.
For the rest, we sum the left, current, and right neighbors.

Logic Calculation:

output[0] = input[-1] (no left neighbor) + input[0] + input[1] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 
output[1] = input[0] + input[1] + input[2] = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3
output[2] = input[1] + input[2] + input[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
output[3] = input[2] + input[3] + input[4] = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
output[4] = input[3] + input[4] + input[5] = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
output[5] = input[4] + input[5] + input[6] = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
output[6] = input[5] + input[6] + input[7] = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18
output[7] = input[6] + input[7] + input[8] = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21
output[8] = input[7] + input[8] + input[9] = 7 + 8 + 9 = 24
output[9] = input[8] + input[9] + input[10] (no right neighbor) = 8 + 9 + 0 = 17

Memory Transfer: The output array is copied from the device memory back to the host memory.

Therefore, the output array after applying the stencil operation is: 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 17.
